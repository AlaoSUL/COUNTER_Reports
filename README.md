### What is COUNTER?

Since its inception in 2002, Counting Online Usage Networked Electronic Resources (COUNTER) has been focused on providing a code of practice that help ensure librarians have access to consistent, comparable, and credible usage reporting for their online scholarly information. The COUNTER Code of Practice provides guidance on data elements to be measured and definitions of these data elements, as well as guidelines for output report content and formatting and requirements for data processing and auditing. To have their usage statistics and reports designated COUNTER compliant, content providers MUST provide usage statistics that conform to the current Code of Practice.

Project COUNTER’s mission “COUNTER exists to develop and maintain the standard for counting and reporting the use of electronic resources. It will ensure that content providers can implement the code of practice efficiently and that their library customers and users will receive relevant usage reports in the format they need.”

COUNTER's standardized usage reports allow libraries to:

• Compare usage easily across different publisher platforms & vendors and reports/formats are standard
• Assess user activity, in relationship to their content & improve user experience
• Inform renewal and new purchasing decisions
• Justify budget spend to their stakeholders
• Inform faculty/power-users about the value & use of current library resources
• Derive “cost-per-use” for content

### Whom is COUNTER for?

The COUNTER Code of Practice helps librarians demonstrate the value of electronic resources by facilitating the recording and reporting of online resource usage stats in a consistent and credible way.

The implementation of the Code of Practice helps publishers and vendors support their library customers and provide statistics comparable with those of their competitors.

In the manual you will see:

- the key metrics that show user activity on a platform
- most importantly, how to calculate usage per book or journal
- the main COUNTER reports and how to use them
- how to track trends by comparing the correct figures between Release 4 and Release 5 reports

1. Books: Understanding metrics and standard views

It explains:

Item Metrics
Title Metrics
Calculating cost per use
Reports
Hourly sessions
Automatic time-outs

2. Journals: Understanding metrics and standard views

It explains:

3. Comparing Counts between Release 4 and Release 5

We look at examples of the new Release 5 Standard Views, and compare them to the corresponding
Release 4 reports. This will highlight the new metric types so that you can
see how they affect cost-per-use calculations, and how they offer new possibilities for the usage analysis.
